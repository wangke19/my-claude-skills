## Name
pr:check-reviews

## Synopsis
/pr:check-reviews [PR number (optional - uses current branch if omitted)]

## Description
This command automates the process of addressing PR review comments by fetching all comments from a pull request, categorizing them by priority (blocking, change requests, questions, suggestions), and systematically addressing each one. It intelligently filters out outdated comments, bot-generated content, and oversized responses to optimize context usage. The command handles code changes, posts replies to reviewers, and maintains a clean git history by amending relevant commits rather than creating unnecessary new ones.

## Implementation

### Step 0: Checkout the PR Branch

1. **Determine PR number**: Use $ARGUMENTS if provided, otherwise `gh pr list --head <current-branch>`
2. **Checkout**: Use `gh pr checkout <PR_NUMBER>` if not already on the branch, then `git pull`
3. **Verify clean working tree**: Run `git status`. If uncommitted changes exist, ask user how to proceed

### Step 1: Fetch PR Context

1. **Fetch PR metadata with selective filtering**:

   a. **First pass - Get metadata only** (IDs, authors, lengths, URLs):
   ```bash
   # Get issue comments (general PR comments - main conversation)
   gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json comments --jq '.comments | map({
     id,
     author: .author.login,
     length: (.body | length),
     url,
     createdAt,
     type: "issue_comment"
   })'

   # Get reviews (need REST API for numeric IDs)
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/reviews --jq 'map({
     id,
     author: .user.login,
     length: (.body | length),
     state,
     submitted_at,
     type: "review"
   })'

   # Get review comments (inline code comments)
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/comments --jq 'map({
     id,
     author: .user.login,
     length: (.body | length),
     path,
     line,
     created_at,
     type: "review_comment"
   })'
   ```

   b. **Apply filtering logic** (DO NOT fetch full body yet):
   - Filter out: `line == null` (outdated review comments)
   - Filter out: `length > 5000`
   - Filter out: CI/automation bots `author in ["openshift-ci-robot", "openshift-ci"]` (keep coderabbitai for code review insights)
   - Keep track of filtered items and stats for reporting

   c. **Second pass - Fetch ONLY essential fields for kept items**:
   ```bash
   # For issue comments - fetch only body and minimal metadata:
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/<comment_id> --jq '{id, body, user: .user.login, created_at, url}'

   # For reviews - fetch only body and state:
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/reviews/<review_id> --jq '{id, body, user: .user.login, state, submitted_at}'

   # For review comments - fetch only body and code context:
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/<comment_id> --jq '{id, body, user: .user.login, path, position, diff_hunk, created_at}'
   ```

   **Note**: Using `--jq` to select only needed fields minimizes context usage. Avoid fetching full API responses with all metadata.

   d. **Log filtering results**:
   ```
   ℹ️  Fetched N/M comments (filtered out K large/bot comments saving ~X chars)
   ```

2. **Fetch commit messages**: `gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json commits -q '.commits[] | "\(.messageHeadline)\n\n\(.messageBody)"'`

3. Store ONLY the kept (filtered) comments for analysis

### Step 2: Categorize and Prioritize Comments

**Note**: Most filtering already happened in Step 1 to save context window space.

1. **Additional filtering** (for remaining fetched comments):
   - Already resolved comments
   - Pure acknowledgments ("LGTM", "Thanks!", etc.)

2. **Categorize**:
   - **BLOCKING**: Critical changes (security, bugs, breaking issues)
   - **CHANGE_REQUEST**: Code improvements or refactoring
   - **QUESTION**: Requests for clarification
   - **SUGGESTION**: Optional improvements (nits, non-critical)

3. **Group by context**: Group by file, then by proximity (within 10 lines)

4. **Prioritize**: BLOCKING → CHANGE_REQUEST → QUESTION → SUGGESTION

5. **Present summary**: Show counts by category and file groupings, ask user to confirm

### Step 3: Address Comments

#### Grouped Comments

When multiple comments relate to the same concern/fix:
- Make the code change once
- Reply to EACH comment individually (don't copy-paste, tailor each reply)
- Optional reference: `Done. (Also addresses feedback from @user)`

#### Code Change Requests

**a. Validate**: Thoroughly analyze if the change is valid and fixes an issue or improves code. Don't be afraid to reject the change if it doesn't make sense.

**b. If requested change is valid**:
- Plan and implement changes
- Commit and Push **(ALL sub-steps are MANDATORY — do not skip any)**
   1. **Review changes**: `git diff`

   2. **Sync with remote first**: `git pull --rebase origin <branch>` to ensure local branch is up to date. If the branch is behind or diverged, you MUST rebase before committing.

   3. **Analyze commit structure**: `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD`
      - Identify which commit the changes relate to

   4. **Commit strategy**:

      **DEFAULT: Amend the relevant commit**

      - ✅ **AMEND**: Review fixes, bug fixes, style improvements, refactoring, docs, tests within PR scope
      - ❌ **NEW COMMIT**: Only for substantial new features beyond PR's original scope
      - **When unsure**: Amend (keep git history clean)
      - **Multiple commits**: Use `git rebase -i origin/main` to amend the specific relevant commit

   5. **Create commit AND push (both required)**:
      - Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format
      - Always include body explaining "why"
      - **Amend**: `git commit --amend --no-edit && git push --force-with-lease` (or update message if scope changed)
      - **New commit**: Standard commit with message, then `git push`
      - **⚠️ A commit without a push is incomplete. You MUST push.**

   6. **Verify push succeeded (MANDATORY before replying)**:
      - Run `git log -1 --format='%H'` locally and `git ls-remote origin <branch>` to confirm the remote has your commit
      - **If they differ**: The push failed or was never executed. Do NOT post a "Done" reply. Diagnose and retry, or report the failure to the user.
      - **If uncommitted changes remain** (`git status`): The commit failed. Fix it first.
      - **⚠️ NEVER post a "Done" or "Fixed" reply unless the push is verified on the remote.** Posting false claims of completion erodes reviewer trust and wastes human reviewers' time.

- **Concise Reply template**: `Done. [1-line what changed]. [Optional 1-line why]`
  - Max 2 sentences. Do NOT add any attribution footer.
- Post reply:
  ```
  gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/comments/<comment_id>/replies -f body="<reply>"
  ```
  If fails: `gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body="@<author> <reply>"`

**c. If declining change**:
- **Reply with technical explanation** (3-5 sentences):
  - Why current implementation is correct
  - Specific reasoning with file:line references
- Use same posting method as (b)

**d. If unsure**: Ask user for clarification

#### Clarification Requests

- Provide clear, detailed answer (2-4 sentences)
- Include file:line references when applicable
- Post using same method as code changes

#### Informational Comments

- No action unless response is courteous

**Replies must NOT include any AI attribution footer.**

### Step 4: Summary

Show user:
- Total comments found (raw count from API)
- Comments filtered out (with reason: outdated/large/bot-generated)
- Comments addressed with code changes
- Comments replied to
- Comments requiring user input

## Guidelines

- Be thorough but efficient
- Maintain professional tone in all replies
- Prioritize code quality over quick fixes
- Ensure code builds and passes tests after changes
- When in doubt, ask the user
- Use TodoWrite to track progress through multiple comments

## Duplicate Prevention

Before posting ANY reply, verify you haven't already responded:

```bash
CHECK_REPLIED="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check_replied.py"
if [ ! -f "$CHECK_REPLIED" ]; then
  CHECK_REPLIED=$(find ~/.claude/plugins -type f -path "*/utils/scripts/check_replied.py" 2>/dev/null | sort | head -1)
fi
if [ -z "$CHECK_REPLIED" ] || [ ! -f "$CHECK_REPLIED" ]; then echo "ERROR: check_replied.py not found" >&2; exit 2; fi
python3 "$CHECK_REPLIED" <owner> <repo> <pr_number> <comment_id> --type <type>
```

Where `<type>` is one of: `issue_comment`, `review_thread`, or `review_comment`

**If the script returns exit code 1**: Skip that comment - you've already replied.
**If the script returns exit code 2**: The check failed - do NOT post a reply. Investigate and fix the issue before proceeding.

### Response Rules

1. **One response per feedback**: For each piece of feedback, choose ONE response mechanism:
   - Inline review comments → reply inline only
   - General PR comments → reply as general comment only
   - NEVER respond to the same feedback via both mechanisms

2. **Code changes require explicit request**: Only modify code when the reviewer explicitly asks using imperative language like "change", "fix", "remove", "update", "add". For questions, clarifications, or observations - reply with explanation only, do not change code.

3. **Check before acting**: If a comment is phrased as a question ("Why did you...?", "What about...?"), provide an explanation. Only make code changes for direct requests ("Please change...", "This should be...", "Remove this...").
